One Hot Encoding
One hot encoding, consists of replacing the categorical variable by different boolean variables, which take value 0 or 1, to indicate whether or not a certain category / label of the variable was present for that observation.

Each one of the boolean variables are also known as dummy variables or binary variables.

For example, from the categorical variable "Gender", with labels 'female' and 'male', we can generate the boolean variable "female", which takes 1 if the person is female or 0 otherwise. We can also generate the variable male, which takes 1 if the person is "male" and 0 otherwise.
